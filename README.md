## Practicing gem5 
[gem5 getting started tutorial](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/part1/simple_config/)

gem5 is a cycle-level simulator. It's a lot easier than using RTL and synthesizing components in hardware simulators like Vivado.
This comes at the cost of precision, so it's not as accurate as the typical FPGA prototyping workflow.
But it might be useful to be able to use a scripting language to quickly assemble components and understand how our initial designs
react to certain workloads.
